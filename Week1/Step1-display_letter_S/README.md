The first part of the project is to create a window which displays the letter S and allows it to be moved with the arrow keys. This is exactly what was coded in the early stages of the LetterA project.

Make a new folder for this project called Snake.

Inside the Snake folder make a Python programme called snake1.py which is based on code from the LetterA project, and displays a single letter S in the screen, which is moved by pressing the arrow keys, and which is prevented from going outside the window. Test this works with the command 
```
pgzrun snake1.py
```
