We can use `print` to make a long bit of text from two shorter bits of text by using the plus sign. For example if you change your code to
```
print('Lovely weather' + 'for the time of year')
```
then save it and run it you will see a combined statement. But there's something not right about the output. Can you spot what it is? 

Challenge
=========
How would you make a small change to the code so the output would look right?

The code above shows how to output some text. But `print` can also be used to print numbers. Change your code to
```
print(21)
```
and Save it. Now run it by clicking the green arrow. 

`print` can also do calculations. Experiment with this by putting some sums inside the brackets and save and run the code and see if the results match what you expected. For example
```
print(3+4*5)
```
But beware! One thing you 
*can't* do with `print` is mix text and numbers in one statement. Change your code to
```
print('My age is ' + 21)
```
then save it and run it. Notice the error message.

To avoid this error we need to
