# Week 1 - using Visual Studio Code debugging

We have divided the instructions for this project into Week 1, Week 2 etc because that is the way we worked through the project in our code club. Of course, you don't have to follow this time scale - you can work your way through the different steps as quickly or as slowly as you like.

Here are the different steps covered in "Week 1":

* [Step 1 - displaying the letter S](Step1-display_letter_S/README.md)
* [Step 2 - Setting up Visual Studio Code](Step2-VisualStudioCode_for_debugging/README.md)
* [Step 3 - using '''print()''' for debugging](Step3-Using_print/README.md)
