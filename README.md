# Snake for Pygame Zero

This project creates a display where letters follow one another around a window. You can see how this works in a little video, but unfortunately this video won't play in github, so you will have to download it to your computer. To do this first click on the link to the video [snake.mp4](snake.mp4) and in the window that opens find the Download button. Click on this and choose where to save the video. Open the video file once it's downloaded to see what this programme does.

The programme runs with Pygame Zero, like the LetterA project, but in order to understand how it works we will need to explore lists, loops and the range function using normal Python. To do this we will need to set up Visual Studio Code to do Debugging of Python programmes.

Along the way there will be challenges. You may be able to find possible solutions to these challenges by looking at code from the following step, but you'll learn much more about Python coding if you try to solve the challenges yourself first.
