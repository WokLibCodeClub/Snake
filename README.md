This project uses the Pygame Zero addition to Python to create a display where letters follow one another around a window.

The various steps cover Python lists, the range statement and using for loops.

In each step there will be challenges. You may be able to find possible solutions to these challenges by looking at code from the next step, but you'll learn much more about Python coding if you try to solve the challenges yourself first.
